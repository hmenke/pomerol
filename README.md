**pomerol** is an exact diagonalization (full-ED) code written in C++ aimed at solving condensed matter second-quantized models of interacting fermions on finite size lattices at finite temperatures. It is designed to produce single and two-particle Greens functions.

##  Features
  * High performance exact calculation of a Green's function and a two-particle Green's function in Matsubara domain.
  * Written in C++: iterators are used to avoid zero matrix elements and vanishing combinations.
  * Symmetry analysis. The commutation relations between operators are taken into account.
  * Fermionic operators algebra to diagonalize any fermionic Hamiltonian.
  * [Eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) template library for linear algebra is used (mostly its Sparse module).
  * [MPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) + [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) support.
  * [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) is used for the installation.

## Installation
### From source
  Check the *dependencies*: c++ compiler, CMake, Eigen3, Boost (with Boost::mpi and serialization), mpi and git to fetch the sources. boost::program_options is required for building executables.
  - Checkout the latest sources `git clone https://github.com/aeantipov/pomerol.git`
  - Create a (temporary) build directory.
  - In this build directory run `cmake <path_to_pomerol> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>`
    * add `-DTesting=ON` for compiling tests. Default = ON.
    * add `-DProgs=ON` for compiling provided binaries (from progs directory). These include a diagonalization of the Anderson impurity. Default = ``OFF``.
      * boost::program_options is then required.
      * Some of the binaries depend on the [gftools](https://github.com/aeantipov/gftools) library, which will be automatically downloaded in case it cannot
        be found by CMake (use `-Dgftools_DIR` to specify its installation path). gftools supports direct hdf5-saving through [ALPSCore](http://alpscore.org).
    * add `-DUSE_OPENMP=ON` to enable OpenMP optimization for two-particle GF calculation. Default = ON.
    * add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` to compile static instead of shared libraries.
  - ` make`
  - ` make test` (if tests are compiled)
  - ` make install`
    * Shared library _libpomerol_ will be in `<path>/lib`.
  - ` make doc` generates the documentation in the `doc` subfolder.

## Interfacing with your own code and other libraries
 Check the `tutorial` dir for an example of a pomerol-related code that is linked to external libraries.

 The interface to [TRIQS library](https://triqs.github.io/triqs/latest/) is readily available: https://github.com/krivenko/pomerol2triqs

## Documentation
Check http://pomerol.sourceforge.net or type `make doc` during compilation stage for the reference documentation.

The library, _libpomerol_ is built. It then can be used to linking with executables. The example of the latter is given in example section and some working executables are given in prog subdirectory.
Documentation can be compiled with a `make doc` command.
